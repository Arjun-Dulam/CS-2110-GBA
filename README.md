# **Sisyphus: The Eternal Punishment**

## **Overview**
This is a Game Boy Advance (GBA) game inspired by the myth of **Sisyphus**, a figure from Greek mythology. Sisyphus was condemned to an eternal punishment of rolling a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down every time he neared the top. This game captures the essence of that myth, challenging the player to push a boulder while navigating obstacles and dealing with the inevitability of failure.

The game is implemented in **C** and uses the GBA's **Mode 3** graphics mode. It features a state machine to manage different game states, such as asking for preferences, gameplay, success, and death.

## **Game Mechanics**
1. **Themes**:
   - At the start, the player chooses between two themes:
     - **Ocean Theme**: A blue background with light blue accents.
     - **Cowboy Theme**: A brown background with light brown accents.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - The player controls **Steve**, a character tasked with pushing a boulder up a hill.
   - The boulder can be moved using directional buttons.

3. **Death**:
    - If Steve enters the black area, the player "dies" and is shown a death screen.
    - The death count is displayed, and the player can restart the game.

4. **Success**:
   - If the boulder reaches the designated area (e.g., the mountain), the player is shown a success screen. However, the game reminds the player that the task is eternal, echoing the myth of Sisyphus.

## **Concept of Sisyphus**
In Greek mythology, **Sisyphus** was a cunning king who cheated death multiple times. As punishment, he was condemned by the gods to roll a massive boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down every time he neared the top. This task was meant to symbolize futility and eternal struggle.

This game captures the essence of Sisyphus's punishment by presenting the player with an endless task. Even when the player succeeds, they are reminded that the task must be repeated forever.
